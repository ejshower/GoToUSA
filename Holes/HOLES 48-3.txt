Stanley stopped and turned to look at Zero. He couldn't just leave him here.

Zero gave him thumbs-up.

"I can't leave Hector," Stanley said.

"I suggest we go," said his lawyer with a sense of urgency in her voice.

"C'mon, Stanley," said his lawyer. "Your parents are waiting."

Stanley stayed where he was.

His lawyer sighed. "May I have a look at Hector's file?" she asked.

"Certainly," said the Attorney General. "Ms. Walker, go get Hector's file."

She looked at him blankly.
