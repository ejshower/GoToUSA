"Interesting," said Mr. Pendanski. "Let me have your canteen."

Stanley handed it to him. Mr. Pendanski filled it, then returned it.

"So do I get the rest of the day off?"

"What for?"

"You know, you said if I found something interesting, the Warden would give me the day off."

Mr. Pendanski laughed as he gave the fossil back to Stanley. "Sorry, Stanley. The Warden isn't interested in fossils." "Let me see that," said Magnet, taking the rock from Stanley.

Stanley continued to stare at Mr. Pendanski.

"Hey, Zig, dig this rock."

"Cool," said Zigzag.

Stanley saw his fossil being passed around.

"I don't see nothing," said X-Ray. He took off his glasses, wiped them on his dirty clothes, and put them back on. "See, look at the little fishy," said Armpit.
