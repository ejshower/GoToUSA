"Why can't I dig my own hole, but still teach Zero to read?" he asked. "What's wrong with that?"

"I'll tell you what's wrong with that," the Warden said. “It leads to trouble. Zero almost killed Zigzag."

"It causes him stress," said Mr. Pendanski. "I know you mean well, Stanley, but face it. Zero's too stupid to learn to read. That's what makes his blood boil. Not the hot sun."

"I'm not digging another hole," said Zero.

Mr. Pendanski handed him the shovel. "Here, take it, Zero. It's all you'll ever be good for."

Zero took the shovel.

Then he swung it like a baseball bat.

The metal blade smashed across Mr. Pendanski's face. His knees crumpled beneath him. He was unconscious before he hit the ground.

The counselors all drew their guns.

Zero held the shovel out in front of him, as if he were going to try to bat away the bullets. "I hate digging holes," he said. Then he slowly backed away.

"Don't shoot him," said the Warden. "He can't go anywhere. The last thing we need is an investigation."

Zero kept backing up, out past the cluster of holes the boys had been digging, then farther and farther out onto the lake.

"He's going to have to come back for water," the Warden said.

Stanley noticed Zero's canteen lying on the ground near his hole.

A couple of the counselors helped Mr. Pendanski to his feet and into the truck.
