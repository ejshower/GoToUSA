Stanley was the first one finished. He spat in his hole, then showered and changed into his cleaner set of clothes. It had been three days since the laundry was done, so even his clean set was dirty and smelly. Tomorrow, these would become his work clothes, and his other set would be washed.

He could think of no reason why Zero would dig his hole for him. Zero didn't even get any sunflower seeds.

"I guess he likes to dig holes," Armpit had said.

"He's a mole," Zigzag had said. "I think he eats dirt."

"Moles don't eat dirt," X-Ray had pointed out. "Worms eat dirt."

"Hey, Zero?" Squid had asked. "Are you a mole or a worm?"

Zero had said nothing.

Stanley never even thanked him. But now he sat on his cot and waited for Zero to return from the shower room.
