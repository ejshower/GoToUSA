est man in the county. His family owned most of the peach trees and all the land on the east side of the lake.

Trout often showed up at night school but never paid attention. He talked in class and was disrespectful of the students around him. He was loud and stupid.

A lot of men in town were not educated. That didn't bother Miss Katherine. She knew they'd spent most of their lives working on farms and ranches and hadn't had much schooling. That was why she was there-to teach them.

But Trout didn't want to learn. He seemed to be proud of his stupidity.

"How'd you like to take a ride on my new boat this Saturday?" he asked her one evening after class.

"No, thank you," said Miss Katherine.

"We've got a brand-new boat," he said. "You don't even I have to row it."

"Yes, I know," said Miss Katherine.

Everyone in town had seen-and heard-the Walkers' new boat. It made a horrible loud noise and spewed ugly black smoke over the beautiful lake.

Trout had always gotten everything he ever wanted. He found it hard to believe th Miss Katherine had turned him down. He pointed his finger at her and said, "No one ever says 'No' to Charles Walker!"

"I believe I just did," said Katherine Barlow.
