He was awakened one night by a strange noise. At first he thought it might have been some kind of animal, and it frightened him. But as the sleep cleared from his head, he realized that the noise was coming from the cot next to him. Squid was crying.

Stanley raised and lowered one shoulder.

"I got allergies, okay?" Squid said.

"Okay," said Stanley.

"You open your mouth again, and I'll break your jaw."
