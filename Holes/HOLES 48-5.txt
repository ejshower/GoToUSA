"It's cool," said Stanley.

"We had to lift the truck clear out of the hole," Zigzag told him. "It took everybody in C, D, and E. We just picked it right up."

"It was really cool," said Twitch.

X-Ray was the only one who didn't come over. Stanley saw him hang back behind the others a moment, then return to the Wreck Room.

"Guess what?" said Magnet, glancing at Mr. Pendanski.

"Mom says we don't have to dig any more holes."

"That's great," Stanley said.

"Will you do me a favor?" asked Squid.

"I guess," Stanley agreed, somewhat hesitantly.

"I want you to-" He turned to Ms. Morengo. "Hey, lady, you have a pen and paper I can borrow?"

She gave it to him, and Squid wrote down a phone number which he gave to Stanley. "Call my mom for me, okay? Tell her... Tell her I said I was sorry. Tell her Alan said he was sorry."

Stanley promised he would.

"Now you be careful out in the real world," said Armpit. "Not everybody is as nice as us."

Stanley smiled.

"My office is having some difficulty locating Hector Zeroni's records," the Attorney General said.
