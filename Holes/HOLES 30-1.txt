The next day was Zigzag's birthday. Or so he said. Zigzag lay in his cot as everyone headed outside. "I get to sleep in, because it's my birthday."

Then a little while later he cut into the breakfast line, just in front of Squid. Squid told him to go to the end of the line. "Hey, it's my birthday," Zigzag said, staying where he was. "It's not your birthday," said Magnet, who was standing behind Squid.

"Is too," said Zigzag. "July 8."

Stanley was behind Magnet. He didn't know what day of the week it was, let alone the date. It could have been July 8, but how would Zigzag know?

He tried to figure out how long he'd been at Camp Green Lake, if indeed it was July 8. "I came here on May 24," he said aloud. "So that means I've been here . . ." "Forty-six days," said Zero.
